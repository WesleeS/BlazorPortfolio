I am from bed. <br>
<br>
From dusk to dawn,<br>
I am from the creeking floor in the dark,<br>
a night owl uncomfortable with the buzz of tinnitus.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am from avocados grown in shot glasses, a product of passion and interest.<br>
<br>
I'm from scallions grown from leftover scraps<br>
and <br>
Taking pictures when anything successfully blooms.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm from the desire to make change for the positive<br>
but without making a wave.<br>
<br>
From "The Golden Rule", to "Do Unto Others", and<br>
an understanding that stress and failure are ok.<br>
<br>
I'm from morality over substance,<br>
that being present for others and empethetic is more important than any worship.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm from birdwatching in the backyard,<br>
Never one to peacock or stand out<br>
But to watch, and listen.<br>
<br>
I'm from the passion of making 49 cent ramen with 12 dollar salmon cuts<br>
And from cooking food warm enough, I can show others how they make me feel.<br>
<br>
From growing up without a Father<br>
but with the ideals of one to stand by;<br>
<br>
And a much more kindly Mother and Sister to walk with me.
