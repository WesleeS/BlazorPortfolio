                A picture of my bird, I didn't have a good photo on file.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a self driven Computer Scientist who got their foot in the waters early with a computer at the age of 4.
                I (obviously) didn't code at 4 years old, and unless you count the online "Hour of Code" site at the age of 8(which I don't fully) 
                I started at the age of 12 with programming. A little sequential, don't you think? By 16 I had more or less fully started to come 
                into my own with coding -- finding a better wealth of knowledge online by this point and learning from friends whom I can only call 
                by their display names. 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on about myself more (not really, I'm infact quite self judgemental), but I have a whole rest of a portfolio to do that.
                <br>
                Wrapping up with interests; I could mention I play videogames, but you'd be hardpressed to find anyone else my age who never has. 
                <strong>text-indent: 2em;</strong>I do digital art with a Huion, host tabletop games of Pathfinder (Currently), FATEcore, GURPS, D&D(3.5,4,5)-- and have been going steady with 
                a campagin that will reach its 1 year anniversay at the end of this month, November 6th.

    <h2>What I do</h2>

        <p>
            If you couldn't guess from the non-Wix or Google Sites page, I'm quite into programming.
            In order of what languages I learned, starting with the earliest, I know:
        </p>
        
        <div style="display: inline-flex; flex-direction:row">

        </div>
            <p> And currently, I'm learning <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/postgresql/postgresql-plain.svg" width="30", height="30"> 
                Postgres for SQL!

        <p>
            <br />
            And as Honorable Mentions, although these tend to be pretty specific or subsets of languages,
            they're still skillsets that set me apart comprehensively. These are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Unity (The engine, I started during C#)</li>
            <li>Godot (Both the engine and the language)</li>
            <li>Blender</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>Command Line/Batch/Powershell</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>LaTeX</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <br />
            For personal projects, I've done my own fair share. I've made a Discord bot, created a MUD, made more
            than a few Unity games, built 2 sites before this one -- really just ask me in person, I'd love to share.
        </p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally I had planned to do Mechanical Engineering when I joined UM. I intended to take the Pre-Engineering course, but it was only
            during the academic planning phase that I realized that goal might be nigh impossible without having to transfer starting at year 2 rather than 3. 
            I had to go through my own fair bit of soul searching and think what I'd want to do with my life. I had decided on it because it would challenge me, 
            but I hadn't known whether or not it would have been fulfilling for me. Thus, I decided that I should instead follow my passion and go for Comp-Sci.
            I've friends online who've gone similar routes, and furthermore this would be an educational track that I could pursue fully at UM -- meaning there
            would be no additional hoops or possibilities of graduating without honors dignification.
